# infernet-container-starter

Welcome to this repository! ðŸŽ‰ This repo contains a series of examples that demonstrate
the true power of infernet, and the wide range of applications that can be built using
it:

## Examples
1. [Hello World](projects/hello-world/hello-world.md): Infernet's version of a `hello-world` program. Here, we deploy
a container that simply echoes back the input to us.

2. [Running OpenAI's GPT-4 on Infernet](projects/gpt4/gpt4.md): This example shows you how to deploy OpenAI's GPT-4 model
to infernet.
